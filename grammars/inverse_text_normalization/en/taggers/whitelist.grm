# Comment:
#   Compile whitelist.gram with higher priority to avoid
#   int.grm converting `at first` to `at 1st`
# Example:
#   at first ==> at first
graph_whitelist = Invert[StringFile['data/whitelist.tsv']];

# Example:
#   at first ==> whitelist { content: "at first" }
export graph_whitelist_structured = Optimize[
  u.Insert["whitelist { content: \""]
  graph_whitelist
  u.Insert["\" }"]
